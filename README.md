## ‚ú® What I learned

This project helped me understand how to use `grid-template-areas` to build a cross-like layout. I also practiced combining Flexbox and Grid for responsive design.

```css
.grid-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-areas:
        ". team-builder ."
        "supervisor team-builder calculator"
        "supervisor karma calculator"
        ". karma .";
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: auto auto auto;
    column-gap: 2rem;
    row-gap: 0.5rem;
}
